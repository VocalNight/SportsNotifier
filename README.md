### Sports Notifier

Pretty straightforward project. Simply extract data from the given website and send to an email.

For testing, add your own email adress for sent and receiving, including password in the App.config file.
Might also need to change the port Number and the SSL config in the main file if necessary. I have added the config for gmail since it's the most common.
